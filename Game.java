- The sum of each roll is added to the individual players points.
- The game has to support two players.
- The game has to support rolling two D6.
- A turn is one player rolling two D6 at once.
- A round consists of both players having one turn each.
- During a turn the combined sum of the dice roll is added to the playerâ€™s total points.
- The first player to achieve a total of 40 points or more at the end of a round wins, unless:
    * Both players achieve 40 points in the same round, in which case the player with the highest total
    score wins.
    * If both both players are tied in score, sudden death is enabled.
    * During sudden death, round(s) is played until a player achieves a higher score than the other
    player
